# Gnüwhine recipe generator

## Generate your own Gnüwhine recipe based on the latest updates from the [tulip markets](https://coinmarketcap.com)
Run `purpletulip.py` to generate a recipe on stdout or `purpletulip.py > recipe.yaml`

Personalise `purpletulip.py` to your taste and portfolio
Purpletulip can track price, market cap, or -if you dare- `percent_change_1h` to create the most volatile cocktails that will keep you coming back for more!

see upstream for more info on ingredients and the robot itself

set up a cronjob that runs tulipupdate.sh

Happy Gnüwhining!
Never take investment advice from a cocktail robot!!!
